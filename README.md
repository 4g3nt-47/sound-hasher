# Sound-Hasher
Insert sound effects into an audio file!
## Background
An app idea I had at [Hack BU](http://club.hackbu.org/) 2017.
## Requirements
The PyDub library. Get it [here](https://github.com/jiaaro/pydub#installation).
## Usage
After all dependencies are installed, the commandline version can be set up as followed:

`git clone`

`cd sound-hasher`

`python mainProgram.py -s originalAudio.wav -n noise.wav -f 0.45 -o finalCut.wav`

Alternatively, there is a download link on the Github Pages site for this project. It contains a basic GUI implemented in tkinter that performs the same functions as the commandline version but requires no additional setup. For now, it is limited to Windows 64-bit machines only.
